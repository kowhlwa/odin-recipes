    <p><strong>Korean Street Toast</strong> is a fun dish. What this recipe
        aims to create is a slightly <em>sweet</em>, super <em>savory</em> vegetable and egg patty is sandwiched with smoky ham,
         melty Cheddar, and a ridiculous amount of mayo and ketchup between two slices of crispy, buttered bread.
         Being a sandwich, the total time to prep and cook is only <strong>25 minutes</strong>.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
        <li>⅓ cup julienned carrot</li>
        <li>1 stalk green onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 thick slices white bread</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 thin slices smoked ham</li>
        <li>1 slice mild Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix cabbage, carrot, green onion, salt, pepper, 
            and cayenne with your hands in a bowl until soft, about 30 seconds.
             Mix in eggs with a fork until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
             Add bread slices and flip a few times to make sure both sides are coated with butter.
              Grill bread until beautifully toasted, golden brown, and a little crispy on both sides.
               Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet over medium heat.
             Add cabbage mixture; cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface
              while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form it into a rectangle 
              that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half into two square patties; 
              continue to cook until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stack patties on top of one another onto one slice of toast and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
        <li>Place ham slices into the hot skillet; cook over medium heat until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Flip and top with Cheddar slice; cook until melted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place ham and cheese on top of patties; top with ketchup, mayonnaise, and remaining slice of toast. Cut in half and serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy this amazing dish :D!! </li>
        </ol>

        <p class = "dish-desc"><strong>Galaktoboureko</strong> is a Greek favorite. What this recipe
            aims to create is a custard baked in a <em>crispy</em> phyllo pastry crust, soaked with a <em>sweet</em> syrup. Reserved for
            special occasions, this recipe takes <strong>2 hours</strong> and <strong>30 minutes</strong> in total, but is all worthwhile.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Whisk 1 cup sugar, semolina, cornstarch, and salt together in a medium bowl until no cornstarch clumps remain.</li>
                <li>Bring milk to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Gradually stir in semolina mixture with a wooden spoon.
                    Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from the heat and keep warm.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed.
                    Add 1/2 cup sugar and beat for a full 10 minutes until thick and pale. Stir in vanilla.</li>
                <li>Fold mixture into the hot semolina mixture. Partially cover the pan and set aside to cool.
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place one phyllo sheet into the pan and brush with melted butter; repeat with six more sheets.</li>
                <li>Pour custard into the pan.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining phyllo sheets, one at a time, brushing each with butter.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is crisp and custard filling has set, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>When the custard is just about finished baking, stir remaining 1 cup sugar and water together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Remove custard from the oven and spoon hot syrup over top, particularly around the edges.</li>
                <li>Let cool to room temperature, then cut into 16 squares and serve.</li>
                <li>Enjoy this amazing dish :D!! </li>
